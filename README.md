# Humidity-Temperature datalogger using RaspberryPi Zero W

Project for _humidity_ and _temperature_ datalogger using
[DHT22](https://www.adafruit.com/product/385) sensor.

## Hardware

For this project we'll use the following hardware:

- a RaspberryPi Zero W computer (should work on any RaspberryPi);
- a **DHT22** humidity and temperature sensor with PCB (which allows us to
  avoid soldering the 10 kÎ© pullup resistor required);
- a powerbank to power the RaspberryPi outdoor;
